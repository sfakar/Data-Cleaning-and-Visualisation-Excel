# Data-Cleaning-and-Visualisation-in-Excel
## Project Objective
In this project, we aim to create a report on bike purchases to understand customer buying patterns and drive sales growth. I added a slicer to give us more options for filtering.
## Dateset Used
- <a href="https://github.com/sfakar/Data-Cleaning-and-Visualisation-Excel/blob/main/Excel%20Project.xlsx"> Dataset</a>

## Questions (KPIs)

- Average income of those who bought a bike and those who didn't buy a bike by their gender.
- What is their commute distance from work?
- What age bracket purchased more

- Dashboard interaction <a href="https://github.com/sfakar/Data-Cleaning-and-Visualisation-Excel/blob/main/Dashboard.png">View Dashboard</a>

## Process

- Verify data for any missing values and anomalies, and sort out the same
- Made sure data is consistent and clean with respect to data format and Values used.
- Created Pivot tables according to the questions asked.
- Merge all pivot tables into one dashboard and apply a slicer to make dynamics.

## Project Insight
Based on the data provided, the following points can be deduced,
- The average salary of females who bought a bike is $55,000, and the average salary for those who didn't buy is $53,000. For males, the average salary of those who purchased a bike is $60,000, compared to $56,000 for those who didn't buy. With this, we know people who earn more tend to buy a bike.
- People who live within 0 -1miles from their place of work purchase more bikes than those who live more than 5 - 10 miles
- People between the ages of 31 and 54 purchased more bikes.
- 
## Final Conclusion
To improve sales, a strategic marketing plan targeting individuals aged 31 to 54 who earn over $50,000 and live near their homes should be implemented. This demographic represents a key consumer segment, as they often make significant bike purchases. The approach should include digital marketing and personalised promotions to capture their attention.
